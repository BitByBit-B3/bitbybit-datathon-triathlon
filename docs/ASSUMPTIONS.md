# Assumptions and Design Decisions

## Data Assumptions

### Time Data
- **Timezone**: Assume all timestamps are in the same timezone (likely UTC or local)
- **Format Consistency**: DateTime strings follow standard formats, with fallback parsing for variations
- **Business Hours**: Services likely operate during standard business hours (9 AM - 5 PM)
- **Processing Time**: Reasonable range is 5 minutes to 8 hours, with most services under 2 hours

### Staffing Data
- **Minimum Staffing**: Every section needs at least 1 employee on duty
- **Maximum Staffing**: Reasonable upper bound is ~50 employees per section per day
- **Work Hours**: Standard 8-hour workdays when estimating employees from task time
- **Section Consistency**: Section IDs are stable identifiers across time periods

### Task Data
- **Task-Section Mapping**: Tasks belong to sections, relationship is stable
- **Task Complexity**: Different tasks have inherently different processing times
- **Missing Names**: Nullable task/section names don't affect core predictions

## Model Assumptions

### Baseline Strategy
- **Median Robustness**: Median is more robust than mean for potentially skewed distributions
- **Hierarchical Fallbacks**: More specific groupings (task+time) are better than general (task only)
- **Temporal Patterns**: Hour of day and day of week affect both processing time and staffing needs
- **Default Values**: When all else fails, use reasonable business defaults

### Feature Engineering
- **Time Cyclicality**: Hour and weekday have cyclical patterns
- **Weekend Effect**: Weekends likely have different patterns than weekdays
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Monthly/quarterly patterns may exist but are secondary
- **Missing Data**: Missing features can be imputed with median/mode values

## Business Logic Assumptions

### Service Processing (Task 1)
- **Queue Effect**: Higher queue numbers may correlate with longer waits, not processing time
- **Document Upload**: Pre-uploaded documents may reduce processing time
- **Task Complexity**: Different task types have inherently different durations
- **Staff Experience**: Processing time variations partly due to staff efficiency (not modeled)

### Staffing Requirements (Task 2)
- **Demand Patterns**: Staffing follows predictable daily/weekly patterns
- **Section Specialization**: Different sections have different baseline staffing needs
- **Load Balancing**: Sections with more total work time need proportionally more staff
- **Minimum Service**: Even low-activity sections need baseline staffing

## Technical Assumptions

### Data Quality
- **Completeness**: Training data represents the actual operational environment
- **Consistency**: Test data follows same patterns and distributions as training data
- **Accuracy**: Timestamps and identifiers are generally accurate
- **Representativeness**: Historical data predicts future patterns reasonably well

### System Constraints  
- **Memory**: Datasets fit comfortably in memory for processing
- **Computation**: Simple statistical methods are sufficient and robust
- **Dependencies**: Standard Python data science stack is available
- **Platform**: Code runs on standard Windows/Unix environments

## Reliability Strategy

### Graceful Degradation
1. **Primary**: Use sophisticated multi-level baseline with task/time features
2. **Secondary**: Fall back to task-only or time-only baselines
3. **Tertiary**: Use global median values
4. **Final**: Use business-reasonable hardcoded defaults

### Error Handling
- **File Missing**: Continue with available data, log warnings
- **Parsing Failures**: Skip bad rows, continue with valid data
- **Feature Missing**: Use default values, log imputation
- **Model Failure**: Fall back to simpler baseline

### Validation Assumptions
- **Range Checking**: Predictions outside reasonable ranges indicate model problems
- **Completeness**: Must produce predictions for every test row
- **Format Compliance**: Output format is strictly enforced by competition
- **Reproducibility**: Same code+data produces same results

## Trade-offs Made

### Simplicity vs Accuracy
- **Chosen**: Robust baselines over complex ML models
- **Rationale**: Competition timeframe favors reliable, interpretable methods
- **Risk**: May miss complex patterns that ML could capture
- **Mitigation**: Optional ML models available but default to baseline

### Speed vs Precision
- **Chosen**: Fast statistical methods over iterative optimization
- **Rationale**: Need reliable execution in competition environment
- **Risk**: Suboptimal predictions in some edge cases
- **Mitigation**: Careful feature engineering to maximize baseline performance

### Coverage vs Accuracy
- **Chosen**: Always produce predictions, even with limited data
- **Rationale**: Competition requires predictions for all test rows
- **Risk**: Some predictions may be poor due to insufficient similar training data
- **Mitigation**: Multi-level fallback strategy ensures reasonable defaults

## Future Considerations

If this were a production system, we would additionally consider:
- Real-time model updating as new data arrives
- A/B testing of different prediction strategies
- Integration with scheduling and resource planning systems
- Monitoring and alerting for prediction quality degradation
- More sophisticated time series methods for trend detection
