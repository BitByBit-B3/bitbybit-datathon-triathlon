## Problem Understanding

### Task 1: Service Processing Time Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict how long a service will take to complete after staff begin processing
- **Input**: Date, time, and task_id for each service request
- **Output**: Processing time in minutes (integer)
- **Business Context**: Helps with scheduling and resource allocation

### Task 2: Staffing Level Prediction  
- **Objective**: Predict number of employees needed for each section on a given day
- **Input**: Date and section_id
- **Output**: Number of employees (integer, minimum 1)
- **Business Context**: Supports workforce planning and cost optimization

## Data Analysis

### Training Data Overview
```
Dataset              Rows     Columns    Key Features
bookings_train.csv   [X]      [Y]        check_in/out_time, task_id, satisfaction
tasks.csv            [X]      [Y]        task_id → section_id mapping
staffing_train.csv   [X]      [Y]        employees_on_duty, total_task_time
```

### Key Insights
1. **Processing Time Patterns**:
   - Range: [X] to [Y] minutes
   - Median: [X] minutes  
   - Strong correlation with task type and time of day

2. **Staffing Patterns**:
   - Range: [X] to [Y] employees per section
   - Median: [X] employees
   - Clear weekday vs weekend differences

3. **Data Quality Issues**:
   - Missing timestamps: [X]% of bookings
   - Missing staffing data: [X]% of section-days
   - Outliers: [X]% of processing times > 4 hours

## Methodology

### Feature Engineering

#### Task 1 Features
- **Temporal**: Hour of day, day of week, month
- **Task-related**: task_id, section_id (from task mapping)
- **Derived**: Time categories (morning/afternoon/evening)
- **Boolean**: Weekend indicator, business hours flag

#### Task 2 Features  
- **Temporal**: Weekday, month, quarter
- **Section-related**: section_id
- **Derived**: Weekend indicator, month-end/start flags

### Model Architecture

#### Baseline Strategy
Multi-level median lookup with intelligent fallbacks:

**Task 1 Fallback Hierarchy**:
1. task_id + hour + weekday
2. task_id + hour  
3. task_id + weekday
4. task_id only
5. hour + weekday
6. hour only
7. Global median

**Task 2 Fallback Hierarchy**:
1. section_id + weekday
2. section_id only
3. weekday only  
4. Global median

#### Advanced Models (Optional)
- Linear regression with standardized features
- Ensemble combining baseline (70%) + ML model (30%)
- Enabled via `USE_ADVANCED_MODELS=1` environment variable

### Target Engineering

#### Task 1 Target
- **Primary**: `check_out_time - check_in_time` in minutes
- **Cleaning**: Remove negative durations, cap at 480 minutes
- **Fallback**: If timestamps unavailable, [describe fallback strategy]

#### Task 2 Target
- **Primary**: `employees_on_duty` from staffing data
- **Fallback**: Estimate from `total_task_time_minutes / 480` (8-hour workday assumption)

### Training Performance

#### Task 1: Processing Time Prediction

Training Set Performance:
- MAE: [X.X] minutes
- RMSE: [X.X] minutes

```

#### Task 2: Staffing Prediction  
```
Training Set Performance:
- MAE: [X.X] employees
- RMSE: [X.X] employees

```

### Prediction Analysis

#### Task 1 Predictions
- Range: [X] to [Y] minutes
- Mean: [X.X] minutes
- Distribution: [describe shape - normal, skewed, etc.]

#### Task 2 Predictions
- Range: [X] to [Y] employees  
- Mean: [X.X] employees
- Section Coverage: [X] unique sections predicted

### Model Interpretability

#### Most Important Features
**Task 1**:
1. task_id (primary driver of processing time)
2. hour of day (efficiency patterns)
3. weekday (staff availability patterns)

**Task 2**:  
1. section_id (baseline staffing requirements)
2. weekday (demand patterns)
3. seasonal factors (month/quarter)

## Validation Strategy

### Cross-Validation Approach
- Time-aware splitting (no data leakage from future to past)
- Section-aware splitting for Task 2 (test unseen sections)
- Holdout validation on 20% of training data

### Robustness Testing
- Missing data scenarios (gradual feature removal)
- Outlier handling (extreme values in test set)
- Edge cases (new task_ids, new section_ids)

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Cold Start Problem**: New tasks/sections with no historical data fall back to global statistics
2. **Temporal Trends**: No modeling of long-term trends or seasonality beyond basic monthly patterns  
3. **External Factors**: No incorporation of holidays, special events, or business changes
4. **Interaction Effects**: Limited modeling of complex feature interactions

### Potential Improvements
1. **Advanced ML**: Tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) for non-linear patterns
2. **Time Series**: ARIMA/Prophet for trend and seasonality modeling
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple model types with dynamic weighting
4. **Real-time Learning**: Online learning to adapt to changing patterns

### Production Considerations
1. **Monitoring**: Model performance tracking and drift detection
2. **Retraining**: Automated retraining pipeline as new data arrives
3. **Scalability**: Distributed processing for larger datasets
4. **Integration**: API endpoints for real-time predictions

## Conclusion

Our solution achieves reliable predictions through a principled approach emphasizing robustness over complexity. The multi-level fallback strategy ensures predictions for all test cases while the statistical baselines provide interpretable and stable results.

Key strengths:
- ✅ Handles missing data gracefully
- ✅ Provides predictions for all test cases
- ✅ Interpretable and debuggable
- ✅ Fast execution and minimal dependencies

The approach balances prediction accuracy with system reliability, making it well-suited for the competition constraints and real-world deployment considerations.
